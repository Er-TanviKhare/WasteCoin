# ♻️ WasteCoin — Incentive-Driven Smart Recycling App

WasteCoin is a **mobile-based sustainability rewards application** designed to **bridge the gap between smart waste infrastructure and real human behavior**.

Today, **smart waste bins already exist** — ranging from **IoT-enabled bins**, **AI-based waste segregation systems**, to **sensor-driven disposal units** used in smart cities, campuses, and commercial spaces.  
However, **technology alone has not been enough to convince people to recycle consistently**.

🚨 **The real problem is not availability — it’s motivation.**

WasteCoin introduces an **incentive-based behavioral layer** on top of existing smart waste systems.  
By integrating **QR codes generated by smart bins or waste disposal points**, users can **scan, earn rewards, and track their environmental impact**, making recycling a **habit rather than a chore**.

This approach helps:
- Encourage **daily usage** of smart waste bins
- Increase **public participation** in recycling programs
- Transform recycling into a **reward-driven lifestyle choice**
